Programming is the closest thing we have to magic."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"There are two types of people: those who understand binary, and those who don’t.Good code is written once, read forever.Coding is 1% writing and 99% debugging.Merge conflicts are a way of life.Git blame is my favorite detective tool.Programming is an endless cycle of solving problems you created for yourself.The real challenge in programming is working with other developers.The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.Git happens.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.You can’t fix stupid, but you can refactor ugly code.Code speaks louder than words.The only constant in software development is change.Sometimes, code is poetry. Sometimes, it’s horror.Code like you care.Naming variables is harder than coding.My code works… I have no idea why.AI won’t take your job, but another programmer will.You don’t know pain until you’ve debugged multithreading.Software engineering is just applied laziness.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.Comment your code like you’ll never see it again.Programming is thinking, not typing.Don’t push on Fridays.Programming is an endless cycle of solving problems you created for yourself.One does not simply write good commit messages.Don’t push on Fridays.The best debugging strategy is to assume you’re wrong.Don’t reinvent the wheel unless it’s broken.Write code that even your grandma can understand.Commit messages should be as detailed as a tweet.Merge conflicts are a way of life.Git commit -m "Fixed it" (Famous last words).Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.exasaad
