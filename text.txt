One does not simply write good commit messages.Don’t push on Fridays.The best debugging strategy is to assume you’re wrong.Don’t reinvent the wheel unless it’s broken.Write code that even your grandma can understand.Commit messages should be as detailed as a tweet.Merge conflicts are a way of life.Git commit -m "Fixed it" (Famous last words).Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.exasaad
